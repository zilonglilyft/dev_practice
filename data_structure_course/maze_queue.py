"""
The maze problem:
setup: a 2-d array, where 1 denote walls, and 0 denotes roads. Define a start and end points, then find
ways to get the end from the startã€‚

Solution 2: use queue to do BFS (depth first search). Logics:
(1) at each node, simultaneously explore all possible way out
(2) use a queue to ONLY store the front head of each route. At each step, enqueue the next node
and dequeue the current node
(3) use another list to store the current node and its previous node, with index
(4) Once the queue reach the end point, track back the route by calling the list
=> This will return the fastest way out
