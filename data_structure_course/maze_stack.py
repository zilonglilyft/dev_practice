"""
The maze problem:
setup: a 2-d array, where 1 denote walls, and 0 denotes roads. Define a start and end points, then find
ways to get the end from the startã€‚

Solution 1: use stack to do DFS (depth first search). Logics:
(1) use stack to store the route node
(2) at each node, find the next step with a defined fixed order (e.g. up, right, down, left)
(3) if reaching dead end, return the most recent node with alternative route by using stack pop feature
(4) dead end means either a wall node or a node that already in stack
=> This will not return the quickest way out
